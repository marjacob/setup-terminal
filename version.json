  "body": "This release brings all of the preview changes in Windows Terminal 1.8 to the stable channel. Notable changes include:\r\n\r\n* Windows can now be **named** for automation and scripting purposes\r\n   * With the `-w` parameter, as in `wt -w razzle` and `wt -w dazzle` (#9300)\r\n* A profile can now specify how it will appear when it's not focused via the `unfocusedAppearance` settings.json key (#8392)\r\n   * Supported settings: `foreground`, `background`, `selectionBackground`, `cursorColor`, `cursorShape`, `cursorHeight`, `backgroundImage`, `colorScheme`, `backgroundImageOpacity`, `backgroundImageStretchMode`, `backgroundImageAlignment`, `experimental.retroTerminalEffect`, and `experimental.pixelShaderPath`\r\n\r\nPlease see the following release notes for additional details:\r\n\r\n* [Windows Terminal Preview v1.8.1032.0](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases/tag/v1.8.1032.0)\r\n\r\nA [preinstallation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/desktop/deploy-preinstalled-apps) kit is available for system integrators and OEMs interested in prepackaging Windows Terminal with a Windows image. More information is available in the [DISM documentation on preinstallation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/preinstall-apps-using-dism). Users who do not intend to preinstall Windows Terminal should continue using the _msixbundle_ distribution.\r\n\r\nWe've also backported the following changes and bug fixes from [Windows Terminal Preview 1.9.1445.0](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases/tag/v1.9.1445.0):\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* When you rename a window, we will now acknowledge that we actually did it (#9808)\r\n* Terminal will now show a more scrutable error message when your starting directory cannot be found (#10045)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* There was an issue that would result in blank profiles or profiles containing just one setting; it is now fixed (#9964)\r\n   * The only known cause of this issue was editing the settings of a profile the first time you ever launch Terminal\r\n   * If you have profiles named `Default` in your dropdown, this is probably why.\r\n   * We will now attempt to heal settings files broken by this bug (#10143)\r\n      * If you _did_ have a profile that you actually liked that didn't have a name or a GUID or any settings, it will now be broken.\r\n         * (Why? That's just a Command Prompt profile with no useful identifying information in it...)\r\n* We've fixed a bunch of instances of the terminal losing focus (#10048) (#10114)\r\n* We will no longer close a tab on middle-click **down** (because **up** is much more reasonable) (#9842) (thanks @Don-Vito)\r\n* The \"close tabs to the right\" and \"close other\" options have finally returned, thanks to some quick out-of-the-box thinking (#9859) (thanks @mpela81)\r\n* Nested commands will no longer interfere with deleting the `>` command palette mode character (#10164) (thanks @kovdu)\r\n* The \"new tab\" dropdown will no longer go up when it used to go down; we no longer live in topsy turvy-land (#10009) (thanks @mpela81)\r\n* Terminal will no longer create a new profile with the name \"Profile 13\" if you're weird enough to add a new profile called \"Profile 13\" yourself (as an example) (#9816) (thanks @Don-Vito)\r\n* The window rename action will no longer also pop keys into the terminal (#9809) (thanks @Don-Vito)\r\n* You can now navigate better using your key bindings in the Settings UI (focus mode, fullscreen, etc.) (#10121)\r\n* Terminal will no longer let an application emit more than one bell per second (#9812) (thanks @Don-Vito)\r\n   * In other news, a 1-second delay we accidentally introduced before a bell has been resolved (#10133)\r\n* The command palette will now respect your locale when you do a case-insensitive search (#9943) (thanks @Don-Vito)\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n* We should no longer crash on exit nearly as often -- either exiting a shell or the application (#10115) (#10042) (#10031)\r\n* Typing `--tabColor` into the command palette now has a 100% reduced chance of crashing (#10096)\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n* Some of our debug logging was being enabled by accident, so we've restricted its activation further (#10098)\r\n   * This bug caused a significant reduction in rendering throughput!\r\n\r\n## WPF Control\r\n\r\n* The WPF control can now have a background that varies from the terminal background (#10026)\r\n",
