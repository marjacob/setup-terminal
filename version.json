  "body": "This release brings many of the preview changes in Windows Terminal 1.10 to the stable channel. Notable changes include:\r\n\r\n* You can now select a different display language in the \"Appearance\" settings.\r\n* Terminal will now present an icon in the system notification area when \"Quake\" mode is enabled.\r\n\r\nPlease see the following release notes for additional details:\r\n\r\n* [Windows Terminal Preview v1.10.1933.0](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases/tag/v1.10.1933.0)\r\n\r\nA [preinstallation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/desktop/deploy-preinstalled-apps) kit is available for system integrators and OEMs interested in prepackaging Windows Terminal with a Windows image. More information is available in the [DISM documentation on preinstallation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/preinstall-apps-using-dism). Users who do not intend to preinstall Windows Terminal should continue using the _msixbundle_ distribution.\r\n\r\nWe've also backported the following features, changes and bug fixes from [Windows Terminal Preview 1.11.2421.0](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases/tag/v1.11.2421.0):\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* You can now delete autogenerated profiles. That just about says it all. Sorry for taking so long on this one! (#11007) (#10910)\r\n* Bold or \"intense\" text can now be displayed as bright colors, a bold font, or both (#10759)\r\n   * We released 1.10 with the new default set to _both bold and bright_, but have reset it to just bright until we work out some text rendering issues (#10958)\r\n   * Set `intenseTextStyle` (flag enum, default `bright`, options `bold`, `bright`, `all`) in any profile\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* This version of Terminal ships with Cascadia Code 2108.26, which contains fixes for some ligature issues, Hebrew glyph positioning and more.\r\n* In the settings UI, we've changed a number of tooltips to replace \"checked\" (as in, a checkbox) with \"enabled\" because they're toggle switches now (#10885)\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n* The console (and terminal) will no longer hold on to large memory allocations after large I/O requests (#10738)\r\n* Terminal now loads WSL distributions in a different way, and will *not* hang on startup waiting for them (#10967)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n### Accessibility\r\n\r\n* An issue where opening a tab with Narrator running resulted in no output has been fixed (#10971)\r\n* Moving your screen reader cursor by line, character and document is now more reliable (#10991)\r\n   * ...and should no longer cause an occasional deadlock. (#10937)\r\n\r\n### \"Default Terminal\"\r\n\r\n* Command-line applications launched through \"Default Terminal\" now follow the windowing behavior setting (#10823)\r\n* Applications launched into terminal no longer erroneously believe the screen to be 9001 lines tall (#10772)\r\n* We fixed an issue resulting in <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> never reaching handoff applications (#10751)\r\n\r\n### \"Quake\" Mode\r\n\r\n* The \"quake\" window's borders will no longer appear on adjacent monitors (#10676)\r\n* Dismissing the \"quake\" window and summoning it on another display will now properly update its size (#10674)\r\n* Snapping the \"quake\" window to another display will _also_ properly update its size (#10744)\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n\r\n* Saving your settings will no longer destroy them if `settings.json` is a symbolic link (#10908) (thanks @Don-Vito!)\r\n* When you attempt to use <kbd>Alt+Arrow Keys</kbd> with no panes, we will now send those keys to the connected client (#10806) (thanks @FWest98!)\r\n* A crash during startup/commandline execution regarding moving focus to a new pane has been quashed (#11040) (thanks @Rosefield!)\r\n\r\n### Terminal Emulation\r\n\r\n* You can no longer erroneously interact with mouse-mode applications at bad coordinates when they are scrolled away (#10642)\r\n* Selected text will no longer move off of its selected line as more text is output... (#10749)\r\n   * ... until it no longer fits on screen, at which point it absolutely will.\r\n* The alternate buffer now inherits its cursor state from the main buffer (#10843) (#10878) (thanks @j4james!)\r\n* We've put a sock in a very loud exception handler (#10901)\r\n* We will no longer try to resize the display if the size hasn't changed, and no longer clear your selection (#10895) (thanks @Don-Vito!)\r\n* C1 control characters in `SetConsoleTitle` will no longer cause Terminal to lose sanity (#10847) (thanks @j4james!)\r\n* The terminal will no longer scroll vertically if you have a horizontal wheel (#10979)\r\n* `RIS` no longer even has a _chance_ of failing (thanks to @amie42 for spotting this after the PR merged!) (#10661)\r\n\r\n### User Interface\r\n\r\n* No longer will dropdown menus and combo boxes fly wildly off the screen if you scroll or drag the window! Rejoice! (#10922)\r\n* Restoring from fullscreen no longer accidentally counts the window border as part of the new size (#10737)\r\n* The window border is likewise ignored when calculating the initial position of the window (#10902)\r\n* We have removed a double scrollbar from the settings UI, which was a fix for another issue, which has now been fixed properly (#10716) (thanks @mimvdb!)\r\n* We've fixed some focus tracking bugs that occur during complicated command line handling (#10978)\r\n* There is no longer an annoying issue where some people on non-100%-scaling displays would not be able to use the tab bar when maximized (#10746)\r\n* The settings UI animations are now slightly less obnoxious (#10934) (thanks @Don-Vito!)",
