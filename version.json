  "body": "This release brings many of the preview changes in Windows Terminal 1.9 to the stable channel.\r\n\r\nYou may not yet see this release in the Store. We are trying a new \"slow rollout\" system that follows the Windows Insider program. You can always install a new build from this repository!\r\n\r\nNotable changes include:\r\n\r\n* Terminal now supports pinning an instance to the top of the screen that you can summon at any time (colloquially referred to as \"Quake Mode\") (#9785) (#9956) (#9977) (#10108) (#10113) (#10150)\r\n   * It is bound by default to <kbd>Win+`</kbd> (#10122)\r\n* Terminal now supports mouse input for Windows console applications! (#9970) (#10138)\r\n* The Appearance page will now show you a (tiny) preview of the Terminal (#9527)\r\n\r\nPlease note that the following features are **not** included in the 1.9 stable release:\r\n\r\n* The ability to set Windows Terminal (stable) as the default console application host\r\n* The live action editor in the Settings UI\r\n\r\nPlease see the following release notes for additional details:\r\n\r\n* [Windows Terminal Preview v1.9.1445.0](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases/tag/v1.9.1445.0)\r\n* This release includes changes from an undocumented v1.9.1523.0 release. These changes will be indicated below.\r\n\r\nA [preinstallation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/desktop/deploy-preinstalled-apps) kit is available for system integrators and OEMs interested in prepackaging Windows Terminal with a Windows image. More information is available in the [DISM documentation on preinstallation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/preinstall-apps-using-dism). Users who do not intend to preinstall Windows Terminal should continue using the _msixbundle_ distribution.\r\n\r\nWe've also backported the following changes and bug fixes from [Windows Terminal Preview 1.10.1933.0](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases/tag/v1.10.1933.0):\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* This version of Terminal comes with [Cascadia Code 2106.17]. This version of the Cascadia family of fonts refines the \"cursive\" italic letter forms to have more universally-acceptable shapes and introduces support for Hebrew and Arabic glyphs.\r\n* Terminal windows launched via \"Open Here\" will open new tabs in the same directory (#10546) (thanks @ianjoneill)\r\n* The \"quake mode\" action is now named \"Summon Quake window\" instead of \"Global summon something something window \\_quake\" (#10641)\r\n* The opacity slider will now display a `%` sign like it should have to begin with (#10369) (thanks @chingucoding)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* An accessibility issue that resulted in misshapen selection regions has been fixed (#10544)\r\n* Terminal will no longer minimize itself when targeted by a commandline application (#10389)\r\n   * ... or when you target it with `-w` (#10396)\r\n* We will no longer destroy commands using `iterateOn` when you press _Save_ (#10373)\r\n* Nested commands now dismiss more reliably when using the command palette (#10392) (thanks @kovdu)\r\n* We will not attempt to not un-toggle the command palette if you choose to toggle it while it is open (#10423) (thanks @kovdu)\r\n* When we encounter a malformed fragment document, we will _no longer_ fail to read any future fragment documents (#10601)\r\n* The action editor should now be more _usable_ in Light theme (#10412)\r\n* \"Open Windows Terminal Here\" will now appear in your language (#10446)\r\n* <sup>1.9.1523.0</sup> Terminal will no longer exit unceremoniously when your `startingDirectory` cannot be found (#10263)\r\n* <sup>1.9.1523.0</sup> A window that receives an incoming console application will now spring to the foreground (#10217)\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n* During heavy output load, we will spend a lot less time ...\r\n   * formatting VT strings (#10426) (thanks @skyline75489!)\r\n   * creating temporary `string_view`s (#10471) (thanks @skyline75489!)\r\n   * notifying an accessibility channel that has been disconnected (#10537) (#10569)\r\n   * emitting debugging information (#10533)\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n\r\n* Terminal should crash less often when you are closing a tab (#10549)\r\n* We've fixed a crash in reloading the settings with the Settings page open (#10390)\r\n* An application setting the Terminal background should probably not crash it, huh? (#10357)\r\n* <sup>1.9.1523.0</sup> If our packaged fonts cannot be found, we will now be more robust and less likely to faceplant on launch (#10260)\r\n* <sup>1.9.1523.0</sup> The \"default terminal\" feature no longer causes crashes on OS versions where it is unavailable (#10238)\r\n* <sup>1.9.1523.0</sup> If we can't accept handoff (\"default terminal\") connections when we start, we'll no longer crash on launch (#10261)\r\n* The settings UI will no longer overflow its frame on launch/reload (#10619) (thanks @mimvdb)\r\n* Terminal will try to do a better job recovering the profile you were looking at when the settings reload (#10618) (thanks @mimvdb)\r\n* <sup>1.9.1523.0</sup> The \"default terminal\" dropdown has been fixed for High Contrast users (#10185)\r\n\r\n### VT Support\r\n\r\n* `RIS` will now reset mouse mode and encoding (#10602)\r\n* `DECSET 12` (enable/disable cursor blink) is no longer ignored (#10589)\r\n\r\n## WPF Control\r\n\r\n* We've fixed an issue in the WPF control's 64-bit build that resulted in hilarious colors (#10486)\r\n\r\n## Documentation, Schema and Code Health\r\n\r\nThank you to @j4james, @ayushman16, @onerandomusername, @ealap, @LuanVSO and\r\n@WSLUser for contributions to the documentation, code health, build scripts and\r\nJSON schema document.\r\n\r\nAdditional thanks to @jsoref for maintaining the [check-spelling action] and\r\nkeeping Terminal's spell checker up to date!\r\n\r\n[check-spelling action]: https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling\r\n[Cascadia Code 2106.17]: https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases/tag/v2106.17\r\n",
