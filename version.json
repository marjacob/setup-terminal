  "body": "This is a significant servicing release to fix a number of huge issues in 1.12.\r\n\r\nThis release was made available to insiders in the Dev and Beta channels on March 25, and will be generally available to\r\neveryone once it is considered stable. You can always install the update from this release page or using `winget`.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Preinstallation Kit info</summary>\r\n\r\nA [preinstallation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/desktop/deploy-preinstalled-apps) kit is available for system integrators and OEMs interested in prepackaging Windows Terminal with a Windows image. More information is available in the [DISM documentation on preinstallation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/preinstall-apps-using-dism). Users who do not intend to preinstall Windows Terminal should continue using the _msixbundle_ distribution.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nThis version of Windows Terminal is now distributed in two bundles, one of which works on Windows 10-11 and the\r\nother of which only works on Windows 11. The Windows 11 version is much smaller because we no longer need to work around\r\na platform issue related to our dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you intend on using Terminal as an unpackaged application--that is, extracting the `msix` file--we recommend that\r\nyou use the `Win10` bundle. You will need the [Visual C++ runtime redistributable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you install the _packaged_ version on either Windows 10 or Windows 11, it now depends on [the Visual C++ Universal Runtime Package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/developer/visualstudio/cpp/libraries/c-runtime-packages-desktop-bridge?msclkid=3e1dd82aac8b11ec8f9dbd86d5979ca8#how-to-install-and-update-desktop-framework-packages).\r\n\r\nDespite these distributions having different version numbers, they are built from the same code and there is no\r\nfunctional difference between them.\r\n\r\nIf you install the Windows 10 verison on Windows 11, it will probably automatically upgrade itself to the Windows 11\r\nversion. It turns out that it is impossible to have two bundles with _the same version number_, so it has to be this\r\nway.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n### Usability\r\n\r\n* Terminal can once again be configured as a startup application, and can be detected by tools like PowerToys (#12491)\r\n* There was a puzzling \"Element not found\" error during settings loading; there is no longer such an error (#12687)\r\n* Terminal will no longer mix up profiles when it is launched in response to a console application spawning (#12484)\r\n* Formatted copy will now try harder to preserve Unicode charatcers in RTF (#12586) (thanks @ianjoneill!)\r\n* We have replaced the word \"Summon\" with \"Show/Hide\" in the command palette for improved localization (#12603)\r\n* Our confidence in the settings UI's _Save_ button has led to us no longer backing up the settings JSON file (#12652)\r\n   * We won't be deleting the 61,000 backups we did leave on your hard drive, but what's a couple thousand kilobytes between friends?\r\n\r\n### Accessibility\r\n\r\n* Terminal now announces newly-printed text to any attached screen reader (#12358)\r\n* Command palette search now tries to announce the number of results to the screen reader (#12429)\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n\r\n* We won't crash any longer if you give us a command line that is a directory (#12538) (thanks @ianjoneill!)\r\n* A crash on launch related to multi-windowing and the default terminal setting has been quashed (subset of #12205)\r\n* Fixed a crash setting the hotkey during teardown (#12580)\r\n* Fixed a different pair of crashes, also likely related to default terminal handoff (#12666)\r\n* `ScrollConsoleScreenBuffer` no longer takes the console upstate (#12669)\r\n* Pressing <kbd>Page Up</kbd> or <kbd>Page Down</kbd> with an empty command palette, which seemed like a reasonable thing to do, was taught to _not_ crash the Terminal (#12528)\r\n\r\n### Rendering\r\n\r\n* Font axes/features once again work across a DPI change (#12492)",
