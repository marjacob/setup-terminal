  "body": "Happy New Year!\r\n\r\nThis release brings many of the preview changes in Windows Terminal 1.12 to the Stable channel. Notably:\r\n\r\n* On Windows 11, Terminal now supports non-acrylic transparency\r\n* Terminal will now automatically create profiles for Visual Studio Developer shells\r\n* Terminal will now try to guess which profile to open when it is launched as the ‘default terminal’ for an application\r\n* You can now update the endpoint of an existing selection using the keyboard\r\n\r\nPlease see the following release notes for additional details:\r\n\r\n* [Windows Terminal Preview v1.12.2922.0](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases/tag/v1.12.2922.0)\r\n* [Windows Terminal Preview v1.12.3472.0](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases/tag/v1.12.3472.0)\r\n\r\nA [preinstallation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/desktop/deploy-preinstalled-apps) kit is available for system integrators and OEMs interested in prepackaging Windows Terminal with a Windows image. More information is available in the [DISM documentation on preinstallation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/preinstall-apps-using-dism). Users who do not intend to preinstall Windows Terminal should continue using the _msixbundle_ distribution.\r\n\r\nThis release was made available to insiders in the Dev and Beta channels on December 14, and will be generally available to everyone shortly afterwards. You can always install the update from this release page or using `winget`.\r\n\r\nWe've also backported the following features, changes and bug fixes from [Windows Terminal Preview 1.11.2421.0](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases/tag/v1.11.2421.0):\r\n\r\n## Announcements\r\n\r\n* _Windows Terminal_ is now named _Terminal_! It will, of course, still be called `wt` under the hood. (#12264)\r\n   * _Right now, you will not be able to find_ Windows Terminal _ (that is, with the \"Windows\" part) in the start menu. We are working with the search team to add a keyword match! Follow #12344 for updates._\r\n   * Sorry about your muscle memory. :(\r\n* **1.12 is the last version of Terminal that will support Windows 19H1 or 19H2** (#12129)\r\n   * Folks who are on the Preview channel _on these versions of Windows_ will get a one-time upgrade to the last servicing release of 1.12.\r\n   * This version of windows is going out of support soon, so you may want to consider upgrading.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* We're reworking how Terminal handles environment variables, starting with reverting the changes we made in\r\n  Preview that broke PowerShell x86 (#12140)\r\n* The \"adjust lightness of indistinguishable text\" feature, present in 1.12 preview, has been disabled pending\r\n  some bug fixes (#12160)\r\n* The \"Open in Terminal\" context menu is now localized in, like, 88 languages (#12090)\r\n* The PowerShell profile generator now generates fully quoted paths (#12086) (thanks @ianjoneill!)\r\n* WSL instances now default to starting in `~` (or throwing an `Invalid Parameter` error) (#12315)\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* The cursor should now start/stop blinking more reliably when Terminal is started without window focus (#12094)\r\n* Copying the \"Azure Cloud Shell\" profile will no longer result in a normal boring profile that tries to run `Azure.exe` (lol) (#12147)\r\n* The default \"Command Prompt\" and \"Windows PowerShell\" profiles have been updated to have fully qualified paths (again) (#12149)\r\n* Cursor movement will now more reliably update the IME/emoji picker/input line/cursor highlight for Accessibility (#12210)\r\n* HTML/RTF copy now respects the active background color instead of just the default one (#11991) (thanks @j4james!)\r\n* The \"Duplicate Profile\" button will no longer be enabled when you don't actually have a profile selected (#12096) (thanks @DavideGiacometti!)\r\n* `//wsl$` paths will no longer result in you being unceremoniously dumped in `/` (in WSL) (#12102)\r\n* `~` now works as a starting directory for `wsl.exe` (#12050) (thanks @LuanVSO!)\r\n* Application-controlled titles will be sanitized for control sequences _even if they are set with the `SetConsoleTitle` API_ (#12211) (thanks @j4james!)\r\n\r\n### Accessibility\r\n\r\n* The command palette will now announce if any suggestions were found to screen readers (#12266)\r\n* ... so will the search box! (#12301)\r\n* The tab row/titlebar have stopped acting as a keyboard input/focus trap -- you can use keyboard shortcuts up there now (#12260)\r\n* We've done a pass over the controls in the settings UI and given them accessible names for screen reader users (#12299) (#12324)\r\n* The \"Default Terminal\" section will now properly read out terminal names to Narrator (#12259)\r\n* \"Open JSON File\" is now a better accessibility citizen as well (#12286)\r\n\r\n## Documentation Changes\r\n\r\nWe'd like to thank @eltociear, @BlakeHeimann, @ghost1372, @Schweinepriester, and @ianjoneill for their contributions\r\nto our documentation, roadmap, specs and schema.",
